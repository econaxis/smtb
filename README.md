During the summer of 2020, I attended the [SMTB Summer Program](https://molbioschool.org/en/), originally to be held in Poland but later held online.

I did a project on epidemic simulation using Python. Matplotlib was used to generate all the figures in the presentation. 

Some of the things I implemented were:
 - ODE solver for SIR epidemic model
 - basic epidemic stochastic model
 - stochastic model with movement and radius of infection using spatial tree
 - simulations of epidemic results across a parameter plane, to see the efficacies of countermeasures
